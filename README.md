# ADND
Project #1  Build a Single Screen App for a small business of your choice.
=======
Currently the master branch has been made, and am working on designing notes and will make a fork, test the code, and then merge back into the master fork.  Plan is to make an app about WaniKani.
## 1. Implement general layout and basic structure of the app.
  - [x] Test header/logo to ensure they work properly together.
  - [x] Layout basic structure for the app. (Logo/Header up top taking up 1/3 of screen with ScrollView for content taking up the other 2/3)
## 2. Gather necessary resources.
- [x] Create mock-up of text to be included
- [x] Find Images to use with mockup text
- [x] Add all images to /drawables and all text to /values
## 3. Design and Implement
- [x] Take gathered info and start filling in the app
- [x] General idea is going to be Image -> Textview.  May do full bleed images inbetween to add visual diversity.
- [x] Review layout and tweak.  Seek additional content to add if desired.
## Optional Features
- [x] If enough varied content is generated, possible implement a tabview into the ScrollView to help organize information.
